Question 1
normal test data: OuputTallyRow(12) This is a normal test because the input NumberToDraw is 12, which is an integer.

abnormal test data: OuputTallyRow("12") This is an abnormal test because the input NumberToDraw is "12", which is a string that is not designed for this procedure's parameter.

boundary/extreme test data: OuputTallyRow(0) This is an boundary/extreme test because 0 is an extreme small numbe, even smaller than the start of the for loop, and it is a valid input, since zero is an integer.
